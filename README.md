# Pytorch React Frontend

This project is the frontend for the PyTorch Django fullstack ML engineering article using React.

The backend [PyTorch Django React](https://github.com/timofeysie/pytorch_django_react) project contains an article that runs through the basics of fullstack ML engineering.

This demo allows the user to choose an image.  They can then choose the upload & classify button which will try to classify the selected image using a pretrained PyTorch DenseNet model according to ImageNet labels.

## Workflow

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Original Readme

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
